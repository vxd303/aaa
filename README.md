### Getting started
#### Secrets
All the sensible keys and secrets are read from a file named secrets.properties and placed at the root of the project.
This file is added to the .gitignore list on purpose.
Please ask someone in the team for the content of such file.
In case such file is not present on your local setup you'll see a message similar to the following:
> "secrets.properties file not found. If you are running the project locally please ask your team for instructions."
#### Git hooks
Please add the following pre-commit hook on your machine: this will prevent breaking builds on the CI by enforcing the ktLint check before committing any changes to the codebase.
~~~~
#!/bin/sh
echo "Running static code analysis..."
./gradlew AM:ktlint --daemon
status=$?
if [ "$status" = 0 ] ; then
    echo "...everything is ok!"
    exit 0
else
    echo 1>&2 "...found some errors, commit aborted. Please run ./gradlew ktlintFormat and fix any additional errors."
    exit 1
fi
~~~~
#### Code style
The code style definition follows the [official Kotlin style guide](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/style-guide) with the following changes/additional rules not mentioned there:
- no copyright notice is included at the top of files created by the Audiomack team;
- all comments must be written in English, so they follow the written English rules.

## DexGuard build configuration

DexGuard and Embrace integration now default to the stub implementations so you can run the
DexGuard release build locally without any private artifacts or extra flags:

```
./gradlew --no-daemon :AM:dexguardRelease
```

Pass `-PuseDexguardStub=false` and/or `-PuseEmbraceStub=false` when you need to exercise the real
plugins in environments that have access to the private repositories.

## DexGuard sample application

The repository now includes a lightweight `dexguard-sample` module that showcases the DexGuard
Gradle configuration without relying on the Audiomack app dependencies. The module can build with
either the real DexGuard plugin (when credentials are supplied) or the stub shipped in `buildSrc`.

To exercise the stubbed configuration:

```
./gradlew --no-daemon :dexguard-sample:dexguardRelease
```

To run the sample with the real DexGuard plugin, provide repository credentials using Gradle
properties or the `DEXGUARD_REPO_USER` and `DEXGUARD_REPO_PASSWORD` environment variables and
disable the stub flag:

```
./gradlew --no-daemon -PdexguardRepoUser="<username>" -PdexguardRepoPassword="<password>" -PuseDexguardStub=false :dexguard-sample:dexguardRelease
```
